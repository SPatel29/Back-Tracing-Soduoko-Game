# Back-Tracing-Soduoko-Game

I made a sudoku game/solver using Python's Pygame module

Features:
  - Users can solve a sudoku puzzle
  - Have the computer use a backtracing algorithm to finish the puzzle for you
  - Take hints on what a tile or grid is 
  - Implemented a time feature. Finish the puzzle before time runs out!
  - Implemented a GUI for users to interact with
